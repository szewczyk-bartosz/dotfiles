# Bartosz's Dotfiles
Hello my name is Bartosz, thanks for checking out my dotfiles directory

This is going to document the process of me learning how to use nix and setting up my dream PC using it!

Hopefully I can help someone as well whilst I am at it, and who knows, maybe oneday it will be something worth sharing...
