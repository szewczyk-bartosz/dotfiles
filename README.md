# nixos-config
Hello my name is Bartosz, thanks for checking out my nixos-config

This is going to document the process of me learning how to use git and setting up my dream PC using it!

Hopefully I can help someone as well whilst I am at it, and who knows, maybe oneday it will be something worth sharing...
