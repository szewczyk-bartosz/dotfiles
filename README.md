# Bartosz's Dotfiles
Hello my name is Bartosz, thanks for checking out my dotfiles directory

This is going to document the process of me learning how to use nix and setting up my dream PC using it!

Hopefully I can help someone as well whilst I am at it, and who knows, maybe oneday it will be something worth sharing...


List of things to do:
- [ ] Make the boot part of the config less PC specific
- [x] Switch to a flake setup
- [ ] Switch to home manager
- [ ] Move .bashrc config to home manager
- [ ] Move neovim config to home manager
- [ ] Configure hyprland in home manager


After these are done, I will start to look into ways of making my dream system: 
+ notifications
+ bottom bar
+ right click on desktop doing something
+ file manager
+ easy theming
+ color palette generation engine
+ chatGPT
